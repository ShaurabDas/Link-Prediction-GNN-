# Link-Prediction-GNN-
 Graph Neural Network Link Prediction

 Overview
This project employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch Geometric to address the task of link prediction in knowledge graphs. The goal is to predict whether a link (edge) should exist between two nodes, a critical challenge in fields like social network analysis and bioinformatics.

 Quick Start
To run the project:
python3 linkPrediction.py


Installation Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- NetworkX (optional, not used in the current code but useful for graph operations)

Data
The model utilizes the **WN18RR dataset**, a widely recognized benchmark in relational learning derived from WordNet. This dataset includes relationships between word entities, where each relationship denotes a type of link.

Code Structure

Modules and Functions

`load_data(path)`
- Purpose: Load and preprocess graph data from a file.
- Input: Path to the dataset file.
- Output: A `Data` object containing:
  - `edge_index`: Tensor representing graph connectivity in COO format.
  - `num_nodes`: Total number of unique nodes in the graph.
- Details: Reads a tab-separated file with source, target nodes, and relationship types, converting these into tensor format and ensuring node indices are consecutive.

Classes

`Encoder`
- Purpose: Encodes node features into embeddings using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers.
- Components:
  - Embedding layer: Maps each node index to a high-dimensional vector.
  - Two GCN layers: Aggregate features from neighbors to capture local graph topology.
  - Dropout: Regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Method: `forward(x, edge_index)`
  - Inputs node features and edge indices.
  - Outputs node embeddings.

`LinkPrediction`
- Purpose: Predicts the existence of links between node pairs using the embeddings generated by the Encoder.
- Components:
  - An instance of Encoder.
  - A linear layer (decoder) that projects node embedding interactions to a prediction score.
- Method: `forward(edge_index)`
  - Uses edge indices to fetch node embeddings from the encoder and predicts link existence.

 Training and Validation

 `train()`
- Purpose: Executes a single training epoch including forward and backward passes.
- Operations:
  - Negative sampling: Generates non-existing links for training the model to distinguish false connections.
  - Forward pass on both positive (actual) and negative (sampled) links.
  - Loss computation and backpropagation.
- Output: Training loss and accuracy for the epoch.
`validate(model, data)`
- Purpose: Evaluates the model on the validation dataset.
- Operations: Similar to `train()` but without backpropagation.
- Output: Validation accuracy.


      Main Execution Block
- Initializes the model and optimizer.
- Runs training and validation loops, collecting accuracies.
- Implements early stopping based on validation performance to prevent overfitting.
- Plots training and validation accuracies over epochs.

  
      Visualization
The code plots training and validation accuracies using matplotlib, providing a visual representation of the model's learning progress and effectiveness.
